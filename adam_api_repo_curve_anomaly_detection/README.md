# DeltaOne - Equity Quantitative Research

Anomaly detection on repo curves: the first step is to learn repo curve dynamics with artificial neural networks and then use the model to detect bad repo curves. We use a set of 4 indices as a benchmark: SX5E, SPX, UKX and NKY. We then detect anomalies  (bad repo curves) on over 294 indices. The API is updated every time new repo curves are available on DMDS.
